# Abstract

In the age of information overload, recommender systems play a crucial role in helping users discover relevant content, products, and services. This group project aims to explore and evaluate the performance of four distinct methods of recommender systems: Popularity-Based, Collaborative Filtering, Deep Learning, Content Based, and LightFM - on two diverse and widely used datasets: the Goodreads dataset and the MovieLens dataset. This research project seeks to provide insights into the effectiveness of these algorithms in different recommendation scenarios, shedding light on their strengths and weaknesses.

# Introduction

Our project focuses on understanding and implementing these five recommender systems:
- Popularity-based: Recommendation engines that are based on user popularity or current trends make recommendations for products. These systems don't account for the unique interests or behaviors of each person. Instead, they recommend products that are regularly read, or frequently watched by many consumers.
- Collaborative Filtering: Collaborative filtering recommendation systems are algorithms that make personalized recommendations by analyzing user behavior and preferences, and then suggesting items based on the actions and feedback of similar users.
- Deep Learning: Neural networks and deep learning techniques are used by deep learning-based recommendation systems to simulate complicated patterns in user behavior and item features. To understand complex correlations and preferences, these systems handle enormous amounts of data, including user interactions and item attributes. Deep learning models are effective for recommendations in settings with large and varied datasets because they are excellent at capturing subtle trends in user behavior.
- Content-Based: Content based recommender systems make recommendations by analyzing the content of items (e.g. product descriptions, movie plots etc)  and profiling users based on their interests.
- LightFM: LightFM is a hybrid recommender system that combines collaborative and content-based filtering methods, allowing us to leverage both user-item interactions and additional item metadata.

Our project involves assessing the performance of these algorithms on two diverse and well-known datasets:
Goodreads Dataset: The Goodreads dataset provides a rich source of user-generated book ratings and reviews. It challenges our recommender systems to predict user preferences and recommend books based on historical user behavior. The dataset's complexity arises from its extensive user interactions and the wide variety of book genres and categories.
MovieLens Dataset: The MovieLens dataset is a benchmark dataset for movie recommendations, comprising user ratings and movie metadata. It allows us to evaluate our recommender systems in a cinematic context, where movie preferences are influenced by diverse factors such as genre, director, and actors.

Our findings have significant implications for the development of recommender systems in various domains, including e-commerce, online content platforms, and entertainment. By evaluating the algorithms on two distinct datasets, we aim to gain insights into their adaptability and robustness across different recommendation scenarios. Furthermore, this research contributes to the broader discussion of the trade-offs between accuracy and diversity in recommendation systems.

In conclusion, our group project delves into the realm of recommender systems, investigating the performance of collaborative filtering, content based, deep learning and LightFM algorithms on the Goodreads and MovieLens datasets. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we aim to provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of these algorithms, facilitating informed decision-making for the implementation of recommender systems in real-world applications.
