In the age of information overload, recommender systems play a crucial role in helping users discover relevant content, products, and services. This group project aims to explore and evaluate the performance of four distinct methods of recommender systems: Popularity-Based, Collaborative Filtering, Deep Learning, Content Based, and LightFM - on two diverse and widely used datasets: the Goodreads dataset and the MovieLens dataset. This research project seeks to provide insights into the effectiveness of these algorithms in different recommendation scenarios, shedding light on their strengths and weaknesses.
